# Maze Game using Hand Gesture Recognition

This is a simple maze game implemented in python which uses hand gestures for controls.

## Getting Started
execute: >> python 'Maze Game.py'
to start the game.
I've shown all the controls in the game as well as the instructions to follow the game.
# Remember, This is a computer-vision based application, so Illumination as well as the background plays a huge role.
put your hand in homogeneous background also the color in the background must remotely resemble the skin colour as the
program does skin segmentation for hand detection.
To understand more, read the documentation in the given pdf.
You can use cx_Freeze to convert the file 'Maze Game.py' to executable.
>> python setup.py build
